# Hand Gesture Controller

## Abstract

Hand Gesture Controller makes human computer interaction simple by making use of Hand Gestures. The computer requires almost no direct contact. All Input and Output operations can be virtually controlled by using static and dynamic hand gestures. This project makes use of the Machine Learning and Computer Vision algorithms to recognize hand gestures, which works smoothly without any additional hardware requirements. It consists of one module which works direct on hands by making use of MediaPipe and OpenCV Hand detection which controls the mouse by detecting the user hand positions and it controls all the operations done by the mouse like Left click, Right Click, Double Click, Drag and Drop, Multiple Select and Volume Controller. For all this implementation we use Python for developing the project. Currently it works on Windows platform.
